/**
 * One chord bound to one action, credited to the [HintGroup] that documents it in a help panel.
 *
 * [chord] is a plain Mordant [KeyboardEvent] — `tenter` adds vocabulary on top of Mordant rather
 * than wrapping it, so a caller already holding an event binds it directly. It names the keystroke
 * a binding waits for, not one that happened; the property name carries that, not a separate type.
 *
 * The chord is compared to the event exactly as the terminal reported it — `tenter` applies no
 * folding. A binding must therefore be declared in the form its platform actually produces; whether
 * two spellings are the same keystroke (`?` vs. shift+`?` across posix and Windows, say) is an
 * application decision, not one `tenter` makes on a caller's behalf.
