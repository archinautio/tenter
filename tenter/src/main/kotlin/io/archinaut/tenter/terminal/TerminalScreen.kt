/**
 * Runs [block] inside one alternate-screen and cursor scope.
 *
 * The [palette] is selected by the caller and is used only to construct the renderer. This
 * operation does not collect input, run an event loop, or make the mutable renderer safe to use
 * from multiple threads. A caller may put a synchronous `runBlocking` application inside [block].
 * Input flows acquire and release raw mode separately when they are collected.
 *
 * Entry and cleanup are exception-safe, including a failure after one of the entry operations has
 * already written to the terminal. Cleanup is idempotent. If the block or entry fails and cleanup
 * fails as well, the original failure is rethrown and the cleanup failure is suppressed on it.
 * Noninteractive terminals do not receive alternate-screen or cursor escape sequences.
