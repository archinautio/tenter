 * exhausted) appends one [TerminalEvent.Quit] so callers always receive an explicit quit signal.
 * Failures and cancellation propagate without appending a successful quit event.
 *
 * The matching event itself is not forwarded as [TerminalEvent.Input] — it is absorbed by
 * [takeWhile]. The predicate is supplied by the application; this function does not define a
 * particular quit chord.
 *
 * This function is pure and unit-testable: it does not reference the terminal or any I/O.

/**
 * Produces a cold [TerminalEvent] flow by reading terminal input events with Mordant's coroutine
 * support. Collecting it acquires raw mode; normal completion or cancellation releases raw mode.
 * Only one input collection should be active for a terminal at a time. Compose this flow once in
 * the application's event loop rather than collecting it separately for each consumer.
 *
 * The normal quit path is the application's predicate: [terminalEvents] uses [takeWhile] so that
 * when the user presses the matching key, the producer observes the predicate returning `false`
 * immediately at that event's own emit and stops, letting [enterRawMode]'s `use` block restore raw
 * mode at that exact point.
 *
 * That path alone isn't sufficient, though: Mordant has no raw-mode shutdown hook for *external*
 * cancellation (e.g. an unrelated exception elsewhere cancelling the collecting coroutineScope).
 * A naive infinite-blocking `readEvent()` only observes such cancellation at its next `emit`,
 * which may never come if the terminal looks frozen and the user stops typing — leaving the
 * terminal stuck in raw mode and the JVM unable to exit. [rawModePollingFlow] polls with a short
 * timeout and checks [isActive] between polls so any cancellation, from any cause, is noticed
 * within [pollTimeout] instead of depending on the next keystroke.
 *
 * Terminal rendering, mutable panel/viewport state, and terminal-size observation should be
 * confined to one application execution context. The input reader may run on [Dispatchers.IO]
 * as this implementation does; callers own the dispatcher and confinement policy and should not
 * infer that a merged flow runs on one physical OS thread.

 *
 * The first emission fires once at startup (resulting in a harmless extra render); subsequent
 * emissions only occur when the terminal size actually changes.
 *
 * ### Mordant 3.0.2: `Size` has no `equals`
 * [com.github.ajalt.mordant.rendering.Size] is a plain class, not a data class, so it inherits
 * identity equality — and [Terminal.updateSize] hands back a **fresh instance every call**.
 * Deduplicating on `Size` itself therefore never suppresses anything: every poll would emit, and
 * a naive collector would re-render several times a second forever. Worse than wasteful, that
 * repaint is indistinguishable from a real resize, so anything keyed off "the terminal resized"
 * would fire on a timer and stomp the user's manual scroll. Dedupe on the dimensions instead,
 * which do compare by value, then rebuild the [Size] for the event.
 *
 * This flow intentionally has **no** [flowOn] — it runs in the collector's context so that size
 * reads can be co-located with rendering without cross-thread synchronisation. The caller owns
 * that context; a merged flow does not promise one physical OS thread.
