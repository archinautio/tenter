/**
 * Resolves every [ColorRole] a host application uses — [ChromeRole] plus whatever domain-specific
 * roles the application defines — to a [PaletteColor], all in the same color space.
 *
 * Two implementation shapes exist. A palette hand-authored in Kotlin as a stateless object with
 * [foreground] a single `when` expression gets its completeness checked at **compile** time —
 * Kotlin's enum-`when` exhaustiveness makes "you forgot a role" a build error in every such
 * implementation (see [ColorRole]'s KDoc for the two-enum `when` shape this relies on). A palette
 * loaded from an external source (a host application's own file-backed palette, say) is
 * necessarily backed by something map-shaped instead, since the role set isn't known until the
 * source is parsed; that trades the compile-time guarantee for a **load-time** one. [MapRolePalette]
 * validates every toolkit role before construction; an application loader remains responsible for
 * validating its own domain-role set.
