/**
 * A "used-of-capacity" pip track: [used] pips drawn with [filled], the remaining
 * `capacity - used` drawn with [empty], wrapping to a new row every [perRow] pips. This is the
 * shared primitive behind any discrete-dot render of a bounded resource (health tracks, ammo
 * counters, capacity gauges) — those differ only in glyphs, capacity, and how many pips fit per
 * row, not in the wrapping/coloring logic itself.
 *
 * [draw] paints at an explicit `(column, row)` and never moves [TextCursor]'s own cursor — the
 * same convention as [TextCursor.write]/[TextCursor.writeAt] — so callers can place several
 * tracks side by side on the same row band (e.g. one per body location) as well as stack them
 * one after another; either way the caller decides how far to advance from the returned row
 * count.
