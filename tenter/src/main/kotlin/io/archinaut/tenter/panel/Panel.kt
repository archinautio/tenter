/**
 * One stateful panel declaration. A panel owns its current state, restore state, attachment, and
 * viewport state; [PanelSet] is the only public module that may mutate those values. Each state
 * builder returns a [Presentation], keeping the prepared content and the width that belongs to it
 * together for one frame.
 *
 * Visibility is still the host application's decision. A declared builder must always return a
 * presentation, while a host chooses which panels to include in a [PanelSet.render] call.
