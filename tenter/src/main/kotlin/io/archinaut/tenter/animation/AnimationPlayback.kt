/**
 * Samples a finite collection of animations against elapsed monotonic time.

 * Playback owns the timeline only. It does not own a clock, a renderer, or the application data
 * carried by each [Clip]. Sampling is pure: a caller may sample the same elapsed time repeatedly,
 * or sample times out of order. The input list and each animation's metadata are copied at
 * construction, so later mutation cannot change the timeline or its original ordering. A clip is
 * visible exactly while `startAfter <= elapsed < startAfter + frameDuration * frameCount`; its
 * frame zero is visible at the exact start and it is absent at the exact end. Construction and
 * sampling reject invalid or non-finite timeline values with [IllegalArgumentException].
