 * A mutable grid of single-cell terminal glyphs with priority compositing and per-glyph styles.
 * Characters supplied to [put] and [set] must occupy exactly one terminal cell; surrogate
 * characters and zero- or two-cell characters are rejected for in-bounds writes. Out-of-bounds
 * writes are silently dropped.
 *
 * [priority] and [style] are captured for this grid's lifetime, and callers must supply functions
 * whose results remain stable for that lifetime. Build a frame by mutating the grid, then leave the
 * returned grid unchanged so that its rendering remains stable.
